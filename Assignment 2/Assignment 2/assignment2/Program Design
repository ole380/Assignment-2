Program calls start
	Program enters infinite loop
		start calls a method getInput reads the input, and checks for EOF. If it encounters EOF, ends the program.
		If getInput did not encounter EOF, start calls checkInput which checks if the input matches one of the possible statements and, if correct, determines which statement. On faulty input, a clear error message is displayed. 
		As statements are determined previously, corresponding methods handling statements are called.
